Auto refill v0.1

Right now you need to copy both the cookies and your Account ID to get this to work,

I plan on first removing the cookies part by either adding a browser web-view or making you log in into aldi-tank so you don't have to copy the cookies

as for the Account ID is really hard to dynamicly find the data, so this is for the future for now,

another thing I add is the amount of GB you can add up to maximum of 9 instead of 5, I just don't want Aldi to detect this.#

For now this works and it's doing a great job at it, Will work on it maybe next week or tomorrow
